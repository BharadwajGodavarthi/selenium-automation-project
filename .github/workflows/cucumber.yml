Here is a sample GitHub Actions workflow YAML file (cucumber.yml) that will set up a Java environment, install necessary dependencies, and run the Cucumber tests:

yaml
Copy code
name: Run Cucumber Tests

on: workflow_dispatch
jobs:
  run-cucumber-tests:
    runs-on: windows-latest  # You can change this to any OS that supports your project needs

    steps:
    - name: Checkout the repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up JDK (Java Development Kit)
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '11'   # Use the appropriate Java version that your project needs
        distribution: 'adoptopenjdk'   # Choose OpenJDK distribution (you can also use 'zulu' or others)

    - name: Set up Maven
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        maven-version: '3.8.1'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: mvn install -DskipTests=true  # Install the dependencies without running tests

    - name: Run Cucumber Tests
      run: mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @SeleniumPractice"  # Run the tests based on the tag provided
      # If you want to run all the tests, remove the `-Dcucumber.options="--tags @SeleniumPractice"`
      # Or use the tag that matches the scenario you want to run
